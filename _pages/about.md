## His Name
{: style="text-align: center;"}
**Yu-Jeng** is his first name. **Kuo** is his last name.

He is often embarrassed of not immediately realizing people calling his name. To avoid such uncertain situation, you can just call him **Tim** instead[^1]. This works pretty much every time, guaranteed.

## Background
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Born in Germany and bred in Taiwan, Yu-Jeng has always shown interest in exploring technology since he was a kid - At the age of 5, he threw a coin into his father’s 5.25 inch floppy disk reader and made it stuck (oopsie). Later in his school days, he developed an interest in understanding how things work (through the hard way) - he stapled his index finger just to see how a stapler works (ouch!). At the same time, his burgeoning love for animals and nature blossomed and he read his first 400-page book [Cry of the Kalahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_of_the_Kalahari) at age 12, and National Geographic became his favorite TV channel. He did not know then that these interests will later inform his education and career.

Three years after receiving his bachelor degree in Animal Science at [NCHU](https://www.nchu.edu.tw/en-index) in Taiwan, he moved to Germany to pursue his Master degree in Bionic/Biomimetics at [HSRW](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en). While studying, he unknowingly became a self-taught programmer, having learnt coding through various university projects. This equipped him with the necessary skills to land a Research Associate position at Kempten University of Applied Science, Germany, upon graduation. His research focus was on the aspect of human factors in automated driving. Key highlights include contributing to two publication and presenting a poster at the Human Factors and Ergonomic Society Annual Meeting (2019) conference in Nantes, France, for which he was awarded the Best Poster Award.

After living abroad for 5+ years, he decided to move back to Asia to be close to home. He is currently based in Singapore working as a software engineer at TUMCREATE, building a high performance city-scale traffic simulator.

In addition to C++, Python and SQLite, he speaks Mandarin Chinese, English and German.

## Hobbies
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Despite of all the uncertainties in life, he has still two hobbies that he enjoys A LOT (which he is quite certain about).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Bouldering/Rock Climbing
{: style="text-align: center;"}
He has been around with rocks since 2017. At the moment, he goes approximately three times in a week bouldering or climbing. He is able to send about V6 in bouldering and 5.10d in climbing. He is always planning on few outdoor climbing trips!

### Jamming
{: style="text-align: center;"}
He loves acoustic guitar, especially with finger picking. In addition to guitar course, he also enjoys simply sitting on the grass and improvising something.

## Goal
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Yu-Jeng’s experiment with Nature of Kivvy has arrived at the crossroads and he is looking to explore ways to take this project to the next level. For the next iteration of Nature with Kivvy, he intends to incorporate elements of art and other forms of technology. If you are interested to collaborate or have something to offer, don’t be a stranger! Say hi, and drop him a message [here](mailto:yujeng.k@gmail.com).
