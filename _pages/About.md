## His Name
{: style="text-align: center;"}
**Yu-Jeng** is his first name. **Kuo** is his last name.

He is often embarrassed of not immediately realizing people calling his name. To avoid such uncertain situation, you can just call him **Tim** instead[^1]. This works pretty much every time, guaranteed.

## Background
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Born in Germany and grown up in Taiwan, he has been showing his interest in exploring technology since he was a kid. At the age of 5, he threw a coin into his father's 5.25 inch floppy disk reader. Later in his school age, he decided to staple his index finger just to see how a stapler works. After reading his first 400 pages book [Cry of the Kalahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_of_the_Kalahari) at age 12, the National Geographic became his favorite TV channel.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Three years after receiving his bachelor degree in Animal Science at [NCHU](https://www.nchu.edu.tw/en-index) in Taiwan, he moved to Germany to pursue his Master degree in Bionic/Biomimetics at [HSRW](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en). There, he became a self-taught programmer due to various projects. Since his graduation in 2018, he works as a research associate at Kempten University of Applied Science in Germany. His research focus is on the aspect of human factors in automated driving.

In addition to Python and C++, he speaks Mandarin Chinese, English and German.

## Hobbies
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Despite of all the uncertainties in life, he has still two hobbies that he enjoys A LOT (which he is quite certain about).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Bouldering/Rock Climbing
{: style="text-align: center;"}
He has been around with rocks since 2017. At the moment, he goes approximately three times in a week bouldering or climbing. He is able to send about V6 in bouldering and 5.10d in climbing. He is always planning on few outdoor climbing trips!

### Jamming
{: style="text-align: center;"}
He loves acoustic guitar, especially with finger picking. In addition to guitar course, he also enjoys simply sitting on the grass and improvising something. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Goal
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Currently, he works as a research associate at the Kempten University of Applied Science based in Germany. After having 4 years of experience abroad, he plans to return to Asia in the near future. Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:yujeng.k@gmail.com) if you have something to offer.
