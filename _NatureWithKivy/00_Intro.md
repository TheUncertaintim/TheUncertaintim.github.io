The *Nature With Kivy* is a side project that I started in July 2019.

The backbone of this project based a lot on one of my favorite book [**Nature of Code**](https://natureofcode.com), which talks about how to simulate all kinds of nature patterns with coding. In the original work done by Daniel Shiffman, he explained everything in Java and visualized it with the software Processing. I first read it when I still remember how excited I was when I first read this book in my master. Simulating nature phenomenon and learning how to code in one book was simply mind-blowing.
